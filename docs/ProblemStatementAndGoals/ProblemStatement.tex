 Goal & Explanation & Reasoning\\
 \hline
 Ease of Use & The user interface and user interaction of application should be innate and simplistic so users of all levels can smoothly identify all application's features/components and instructions shown to them.    & A simplistic product will help reduce confusion and time spent figuring out how to use product, which can lead to more time spent using the product more effectively to help improve health and wellness, and make overall experience more enjoyable.  \\
 \hline
 Accurate Data & User data for all components of application such as recipe finder, sleep tracker etc. is outputted and maintained precisely based on the given inputs and communication between user and application. & Must provide reliable and precise data, in order to ensure trust to users that our product works as intended, in order for users to accurately track overall health and wellness progress. Also providing accurate data, that can match or exceed rival products, can provide a competitive advantage and can make it easier to penetrate the intended market.\\
 \hline
 Secure & All private user data, should be protected and application should prevent any data leakages from occurring. User data should only be available for the user unless, user specifies otherwise.  & In society, there are many hacking attempts, and hacking has become a profitable business where the victims are innocent users. So by making application more secure by creating high-level authentication and testing our product thoroughly, it can help ensure more trust to our users. \\
