This document ... \wss{provide an introductory blurb and roadmap of the
	Verification and Validation plan}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
	its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
	the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
	something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
	``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
	just those that are most important.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
	and your other project documents (MG, MIS, etc).  You can include these even
	before they are written, since by the time the project is done, they will be
	written.}

\citet{SRS}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.   You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
	come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{You, your classmates and the course instructor.  Maybe your supervisor.
	You shoud do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
	for the project.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|p{4cm}|p{7cm}|}

\end{table}

REVITALIZE team members are aware that they might have to put on multiple hats or perform multiple roles.

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may just
	be ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates, or you may have
	something more rigorous/systematic in mind..}

\wss{Remember you have an SRS checklist}

The REVITALIZE team's SRS verification plan is to have the SRS reviewed by classmates, group members, and course TA. Classmates already adhocly reviewed REVITALIZE's SRS and provided their feedback. Furthermore, the course TA will review REVITALIZE's SRS to provide more detailed and structured feedback. REVITALIZE team members will meet together to gather all feedback from classmates, other team members and course TA. The team will then assess the feedback and analyze what can be incorporated. After that, the SRS will be refined and updated as part of the SRS verification process.

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Remember you have MG and MIS checklists}

The REVITALIZE team's design verification plan is to have its design reviewed by classmates, group members, and course TA. The team will gather all feedback from classmates, other group members, and the course TA and incorporate it in the design document. After completing the MG and MIS, the team will ensure that their modules match the system requirements in the SRS. Finally, a design walk-through will be conducted by the team to verify the design.

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be verified.}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
	testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static verification of
	the implementation.  Potential techniques include code walkthroughs, code
	inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
	framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
	include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
	tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
	Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
	you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
	that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
	Python.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
	implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
	point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
	here.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{Reference your MIS and explain your overall philosophy for test case
	selection.}  
\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS has
	been completed.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
	developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
	verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
	have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
	explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
	appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
	technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
	References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
	perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
	tests were selected.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
	performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
	nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
	mentioned functional tests.}

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions?}

\wss{This is a section that would be appropriate for some projects.}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item How would you rate overall neatness of UI/UX design of REVITALIZE out of 10? What are elements you like related to neatness? What are elements you would improve related to neatness?
	\item Are colours used in REVITALIZE non-intrusive, appealing and/or contrasting? Rate each factor of non-intrusive, appealing and contrasting out of 10? What are elements you like that elevate these factors? What are elements you would improve to elevate these factors?
	\item How would you rate the overall ability to use REVITALIZE with only one hand/one finger out of 10? What are elements that help with this? What are elements you would improve?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Reflection Appendix}

\subsection{Knowledge and Skills Needed}

\noindent Bill Nguyen: My primary role for VnV plan is to be a back-end developer tester, so some skills needed would be how to write proper and effective unit tests for back-end implementation of project, integration tests that tests the project end to end and with the front-end, and also maybe some tests for performance such as load, stress test etc. for back-end code.\\

\noindent Syed Bokhari: My primary role for VnV plan is to be a Database Application tester. Some skills needed would be how to configure API testing environments and database query accuracy. I must know how to prepare the testing environment, writeunit tests for SQL queries and configure test data to ensure the accuracy of the results.\\

\subsection{How Knowledge and Skills Will Be Acquired}

\noindent Bill Nguyen: Knowledge and skills will be acquired by researching techniques on how to write effective unit tests for the back-end for example using the "arrange act assert" and potentially setting minimum thresholds for code/branch coverage to improve consistency and organization of tests. For integration and performance tests also perform research to find effective ways to test back-end with all aspects of project and applying it often.\\

\noindent Syed Bokhari: The required knowledge and skills will be acquired by setting up practice environments via virtual machines and testing the API implementation with smaller scale applications. Once I can confirm the accuracy of the database queries and API requests with unit tests, I can configure a larger portion of the code to ingest the data from the API and store in the database.\\
