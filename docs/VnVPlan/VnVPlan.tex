\begin{itemize}
	\item Demonstrate satisfactory usability based on laid out criteria
	\item Satisfy requirements outlined in SRS
	\item Build confidence that implementation behaves as intended
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\noindent This document references the SRS \citet{SRS}, the Module Guide \citet{MG}, and the Module Interface Specification \citet{MIS}


\section{Plan}

This section outlines REVITALIZE's verification and validation plan. It begins with identifying the verification and validation team. It then moves to discussing the SRS, design, verification and validation, and implementation verification plans. This section then concludes with REVITALIZE's software validation plan.

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\textcolor{red}{\sout{REVITALIZE team members are aware that they might have to put on multiple hats or perform multiple roles.}} \textcolor{red}{In the above table, mentions the specific roles and sections each team member is responsible for, but if needed, multiple team members can perform other roles for example back-end testers for the Diet Section can coordinate with front-end testers if problems arise, to make sure both components work in unison.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

The REVITALIZE team's SRS verification plan is to have the SRS reviewed by classmates, group members, and course TA. Classmates already adhocly reviewed REVITALIZE's SRS and provided their feedback. Furthermore, the course TA will review REVITALIZE's SRS to provide more detailed and structured feedback. REVITALIZE team members will meet together to gather all feedback from classmates, other team members and course TA. The team will then assess the feedback and analyze what can be incorporated. After that, the SRS will be refined and updated as part of the SRS verification process.

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

The REVITALIZE team's design verification plan is to have its design reviewed by classmates, group members, and course TA. The team will gather all feedback from classmates, other group members, and the course TA and incorporate it in the design document. After completing the MG and MIS, the team will ensure that their modules match the system requirements in the SRS. Finally, a design walk-through will be conducted by the team to verify the design.

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

The REVITALIZE teams plan to verify its VnV plan is to have it reviewed by classmates, group members, and course TA. The team will gather all feedback and incorporate it in the verification and validation plan. The REVITALIZE team will also conduct a walk-through after feedback has been incorporated to verify that every functional and nonfunctional requirement in the SRS has at least one test that tests it in the verification and validation plan. Team members will then run the tests in the VnV plan to determine if the system requirements stated in the SRS have been met. This way, the team verifies the completeness of the verification and validation plan in both directions.\\
The same process will be followed regarding the unit tests. Each module in the MG and MIS will be matched to the tests written in the VnV plan to verify it.

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

REVITALIZE team members will use both a static and dynamic approach to verify the application's implementation. In terms of dynamic methods, automated unit tests will be performed as part of testing the unit system tests. Furthermore, test cases will be monitored to ensure its up to date such that full testing coverage of the code can be done. This includes edge case testing.\\\\
A prototype testing method will also be used. REVITALIZE will not be implemented in one go. Rather, features and functionality will constantly be added throughout the course of the project. Therefore, REVITALIZE will go through numerous prototypes or phases. This prototype testing will act as an ongoing static and dynamic verification of the REVITALIZE application.\\\\
Static verification of REVITALIZE's implementation will be done by performing code inspections. Team members will perform code reviews as part of static analysis where each team member will follow the guidelines stated in REVITALIZE's Development Plan. Team members will review each other's code and raise issues to note any concerns. The purpose of conducting static verification of the implementation in this way is to ensure code walk-throughs are completed, concerns are raised, and best implementation practices are followed.

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

Automated testing and verification tools have been previously stated in sections 6 and 7 of REVITALIZE's \href{https://github.com/BillNguyen1999/REVITALIZE/blob/main/docs/DevelopmentPlan/DevelopmentPlan.pdf}{\color{blue}Development Plan}.

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

The REVITALIZE team's software validation plan includes having a review session with primary and secondary stakeholders to check that the SRS requirements document captures the right requirements. After REVITALIZE's initial release, another session with the stakeholders will be held to validate the implementation. The user will use REVITALIZE for the first time, answer team member questions, and give feedback on the application. After that, as per the feedback, the SRS and the implementation may require modifications such as the addition or removal of particular functionality.

\section{System Test Description}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

Subsections of the requirements will be divided into the events from our SRS, which are Login Page, Sign up Page, Main Page, Diet Section, Workout Section and Rest Section. There will be 1 test per functional requirement, and will follow the same order as functional requirements in SRS (\textcolor{red}{\sout{ex.}} \textcolor{red}{eg.} FR1 in VnV plan is the test for FR1 in SRS).

\section{Unit Test Description}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\textcolor{red}{All modules mentioned below were deemed in the unit testing scope. Calendar, Recipe Results and Recipe Details Modules were out of scope since mostly involves third party data. Main Menu, Label, Search or Add Food and Workout Log Modules were out of scope since mostly modules for UI design and deemed unnecessary to create unit tests. FoodT and ExerciseT Modules were out of scope since these are mainly data types and these data types were tested in the other modules mentioned below.}

\section{Reflection Appendix}

\subsection{Knowledge and Skills Needed}

\noindent Bill Nguyen: My primary role for VnV plan is to be a back-end developer tester, so some skills needed would be how to write proper and effective unit tests for back-end implementation of project, integration tests that tests the project end to end and with the front-end, and also maybe some tests for performance such as load, stress test etc. for back-end code.\\

\noindent Syed Bokhari: My primary role for VnV plan is to be a Database Application tester. Some skills needed would be how to configure API testing environments and database query accuracy. I must know how to prepare the testing environment, writeunit tests for SQL queries and configure test data to ensure the accuracy of the results.\\

\noindent Mahmoud Anklis: My primary role for the VnV plan is to be a System Integration tester. Some of the skills needed would be how to setup system tests that test the integration of all modules. I would also have to know how to write scripts that test the interfaces of each component and ensure the entire system is behaving properly.\\

\noindent Hasan Kibria: My primary role for the VnV plan is to be a Frontend Tester. Some of the skills needed would be knowledge of frontend testing frameworks for our language of choice, as well as knowing how to properly mock unnecessary resources (i.e. the backend) to truly test targeted frontend functionality in the manner we aim to.\\

\noindent Logan Brown: My primary role for the VnV plan is to be a Performance Tester. First I would need to know what tools are available for monitoring the performance of our app and then the skill I would need to learn is how to properly analyze the measured metrics. I would also have to know how to simulate performance on a variety of devices with different capabilities.\\

\noindent Youssef Dahab: To contribute to this VnV, I needed to learn how to design a verification plan for the SRS, Design, VnV, and implementation. Furthermore, as a UI/UX tester, I will have to know how to evaulate user experience and have a good understanding of human computer interfaces.\\

\subsection{How Knowledge and Skills Will Be Acquired}

\noindent Bill Nguyen: Knowledge and skills will be acquired by researching techniques on how to write effective unit tests for the back-end for example using the "arrange act assert" and potentially setting minimum thresholds for code/branch coverage to improve consistency and organization of tests. For integration and performance tests also perform research to find effective ways to test back-end with all aspects of project and applying it often.\\

\noindent Syed Bokhari: The required knowledge and skills will be acquired by setting up practice environments via virtual machines and testing the API implementation with smaller scale applications. Once I can confirm the accuracy of the database queries and API requests with unit tests, I can configure a larger portion of the code to ingest the data from the API and store in the database.\\

\noindent Mahmoud Anklis: The  knowledge and skills required for system integration testing will be acquired by understanding the software architecture and how each component communicates with the other. I will also have to research methods on how to build scripts the can test the entire application's components (Front-End, Back-End, Database etc), where the script is able to pin point the component that led to a failure if there is a failure in when testing.\\

\noindent Hasan Kibria: I hope to acquire this knowledge by reading online docs, looking at code examples, and trying my best to re-emulate tests I find on the internet to fit our specific needs. Once I find myself to be familiar with the technologies and infrastructure at hand, then I would continue to learn by diving deeper into testing principles and following through the targeted test implementation.\\

\noindent Logan Brown: To learn the skills I outlined above I would need to research different performance measuring tools and what they measure using online documentation. Most likely I could use a tool that is a plugin for the development platform we will be using. I will also learn these skills by measuring the performance of simulated versions of the application, making changes to the implementation and seeing the effect these changes have on the performance.\\

\noindent Youssef Dahab: I had two options to acquire these skills and I used both of them. Firstly, I referenced the lecture notes and material to be able to complete the VnV plan. Secondly, I used the internet to gain further knowledge on topics that I needed more clarification on with regards to design, software validation, and implementation. I will also have to review material from SFWRENG 4HC3 to be able to use HCI concepts to better test REVITALIZE's UI and UX.\\
