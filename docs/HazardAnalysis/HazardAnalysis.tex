\section{Introduction}
This document is a hazard analysis of REVITALIZE.

\subsection{Hazard Definition}
As per Nancy Leveson's work, a hazard is a property or condition in a system together with a condition in the environment that has the potential to cause harm or damage. In REVITALIZE, there are safety (keeping records) and security (restricting access to data) hazards.

\subsection{Other Used Terms in this Document}

\subsubsection{Failure}
A failure in the REVITALIZE mobile application could occur when there is a deviation between the actual and expected output. Furthermore, a failure could also occur when a certain state causes REVITALIZE, or a component of REVITALIZE (login, database, etc.), to fail and therefore not achieve its necessary function.

\subsubsection{Safety}
REVITALIZE's safety is its freedom from harm. However, it's not an absolute. Safety is a global property of REVITALIZE. Therefore, when two or more REVITALIZE components interact together, the resulting emergent behaviour may or may not be safe.

\section{Purpose of Hazard Analysis and Scope}
Hence, the purpose of this document is to identify hazards pertaining to the REVITALIZE mobile application, and their causes, and then specify ways to eliminate them or mitigate their effect. The team cannot “bolt on” safety after implementing the application. Therefore, by identifying hazards and developing safety requirements before implementing, REVITALIZE team members will be able to react when their application fails to be safe. This becomes beneficial when something “bad” happens. The team will have a recovery plan.
\\\\ The scope of this project is to create an all in one health and wellness mobile application that allows users to manage their diet, exercise, and sleep by providing them with meal recipe’s based on their nutritional preferences, a personalized workouts planner and a sleep tracker.

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\subsection{System Boundaries}
\noindent The system boundary can be outlined using the following elements of the system: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Main application (with the following subsystems)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Login/Authentication
        \item Database
        \item Backend server
        \item Main calendar
        \item Diet menu
        \item Workout menu
        \item Sleep menu
    \end{itemize}
    \item APIs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Recipe API
        \item Workout tracker API
        \item Google sleep tracker API
    \end{itemize}
    \item Android device (device app is installed on)
\end{enumerate}

\noindent The system boundary includes the application as a whole, the APIs used for its function, and the Android device the app is installed onto. Some of these elements are outside the direct control of REVITALIZE, namely the APIs, server uptime, database uptime, and the Android device itself. However, they are important elements of the system that must be taken into account for proper hazard analysis of the system.

\subsection{Components}

\noindent The components of the system are outlined as followed:

\subsubsection{Login/Authentication System}
\noindent System that allows users to create an account, login, and have their credentials verified. Users can then access their data and modify health goals and plans.

\subsubsection{Database}
\noindent System that stores and organizes user health data. Data will be stored to the user's account and is accessible to any device that logs in with said account.

\subsubsection{Server Backend}
\noindent System that controls the flow of data between the APIs and the application.

\subsubsection{Main Calendar Interface}
\noindent System that displays current diet, workout, and sleep goals/plans for selected day. Users can select a desired day on the calendar and navigate to the diet, workout, and sleep interfaces which are used to modify user goals and plans.

\subsubsection{Diet Section Interface}
\noindent System that allows users to search and add recipes aligned with their dietary goals. The recipes chosen by the user are then added to the plan of the selected day. Previously planned recipes are stored for easy access in the future.

\subsubsection{Workout Section Interface}
\noindent System that allows users to add existing or custom workouts to the selected calendar day. Previous workouts are stored for easy access in the future. 

\subsubsection{Sleep Section Interface}
\noindent System that tracks and displays user sleep data. Also displays sleep/wake-up times based on user sleep goals and habits. 

\section{Critical Assumptions}
\noindent 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Assume user is not intentionally acting in a malicious way
    \item Assume user is not sharing username and password info with anyone else
    \item Assume user's Android device is functioning properly
    \item Assume user's Android device does not contain any vulnerabilities
    \item Assume APIs are up and function properly
    \item Assume APIs do not contain any vulnerabilities
\end{enumerate}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}
The next pages will show the full failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) for REVITALIZE:
