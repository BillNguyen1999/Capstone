\section{Changes Due to Testing}
Formal testing did not reveal any necessary changes in terms of module interfacing, decomposition, or internal design. Changes made to code were to address bugs and logical errors revealed by the testing plan. User interface improvements were made throughout the development process in response to feedback from developers and informal testers.

Bill Nguyen: for the vnv plan, it was more formulation rather than implementation, we looked at how we were going to test our project rather than actually doing it. For the vnv report it was more the implementation of our formulation where we wrote actual unit/automated tests and tested our project fully and than compared it to our vnv plan to see what requirements etc. did we satisfy and maybe find things we need to improve on.
