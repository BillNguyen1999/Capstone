\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
Sustaining a healthy lifestyle requires people to keep track of their eating, exercising, and sleeping habits. This can prove to be a daunting and time consuming thing to do especially when most people are very busy with their lives. The purpose of this project to create an all in one health and wellness mobile application that allows users to manage their diet, exercise, and sleep. REVITALIZE is designed to supply users with the means to improve their health by providing them with meal recipe's based on their nutritional preferences, a personalized workouts planner and a sleep tracker. 

\subsection{Scope}
REVITALIZE will allow users to find recipes for meals based on nutritional preferences such as calories per meal, diet selections, allergies to avoid and ingredients included. The user will be able to count their calorie and nutrient intake through the nutrition logger. The workout planner will allow users to choose from an already existing list of workouts or construct their own workout schedule along with weights, sets, and repetitions. The sleep tracker will provide users with information regarding their sleep. There will be a focus on improving user experience throughout the application along with supplying users with accurate data regarding their health.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
The goal of this project is to make REVITALIZE, for it's stakeholders, the go to, easy to use, quick, and accessible all in one mobile application for effectively and efficiently managing a person's diet, exercise, and sleep to improve their overall health and well being. The goal of making REVITALIZE a mobile application is for it to be easily accessible to users from their phone at any time and place. Users do not have to memorize their health goals or write them down on a piece of paper that they carry with them all the time. The goal of documenting this project is for stakeholders to have a physical system documentation of a functional product that they can refer to when needed. Stakeholders will be able to match the application to the documentation.

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{Primary Stakeholders}
Adults and teenagers who want to improve and keep track of their overall health and wellness via an easy to use, all in one application.

\subsubsection{Secondary Stakeholders}
Individuals who may not use the application directly for themselves or are not directly involved with the use of the application but have an indirect benefit. For instance, personal trainers can use REVITALIZE to keep track of workouts, sleep, and the overall health of their clients.

\subsubsection{Facilitating Stakeholders}
Team 13 members building the REVITALIZE application along with Dr. Spencer Smith and the 4G06 TAs.

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}
The REVITALIZE team members have not completed their investigation of how to make mobile applications compatible with screen reader tools to make REVITALIZE accessible to users with impaired vision.\\

Moreover, the level of difficulty of maintaining and scaling this project is an open issue as it is highly dependent on the implementation. The team has not yet completed it's assessment of the projection of users, costs, and allocated budget to make a current decision on the maintainability and scalability of the project.\\

Another open issue is regarding the way capacity testing will be conducted:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The team has yet to determine how it will find and group a large pool of people simultaneously, ideally 50 or more, to test the application's performance before launch.
	\item Determining how to gather large masses user data points, ideally 1 million+, to test the application's storage capacity and performance.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
There are available products that are similar to the application. An application called MyFitnessPal tracks user goals and calories, breaks down ingredients, and logs activities. Another available mobile application is Samsung Health that tracks various aspects of a user's daily life contributing to their well being such as physical activity, diet, and sleep. It's main dashboard provides access to different features such as dietary monitoring (calories and nutrients absorbed), weight tracking, and sleep monitoring. 

\subsection{New Problems}
Potential new problems that the REVITALIZE team can encounter include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item API failures
	\item Server connection errors
	\item Copy right issues
\end{itemize}
API failures can occur as a result of connectivity issues, a connection breakdown to the URL, or if it's overloaded with requests from the REVITALIZE application. It is possible to encounter copyright issues when using images from the internet to add visuals to the application. This may or may not complicate the graphical user interface design process. A server connection error is less common but may occur due to a network connection error or if the server is offline.

\subsection{Tasks}
Tasks are scheduled and delegated as per the project \href{https://github.com/BillNguyen1999/REVITALIZE/blob/main/projectschedule/REVITALIZE.pdf}{\color{blue}Gantt Chart}. It will be updated throughout the project to include required tasks and their completion status.

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
NA

\subsection{Risks}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Risk 1: Project may be too complex to complete in eight months because it makes use of multiple built-in and external libraries, other frameworks and application programming interfaces
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Probability of risk becoming a problem: Medium
		\item Contingency plan: Change project scope to meet the minimum number of goals and requirements set by the team to deliver the project
	\end{itemize}
	\item Risk 2: What if primary stakeholders are not too excited about using the REVITALIZE application after it's launched?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Probability of risk becoming a problem: Medium
		\item Contingency plan: REVITALIZE team members shall speak to primary stakeholders and listen to their feedback to improve the application.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Costs}
The estimated time cost to deliver this project is eight months. This includes gathering requirements, designing, documenting, implementing, and testing. The cost of launching REVITALIZE to the Google Play Store and App Store are 25\$ and 99\$ respectively.[1]

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
No user documentation is required to use REVITALIZE. Users will be able to download REVITALIZE as a mobile application from either the Google Play Store or App Store. No training is necessary as using REVITALIZE will be intuitive.

\subsection{Waiting Room}
Ideas that are currently in the waiting room that shall be developed, given enough time, include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Personal Trainer Integration
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A user's personal trainer can set their diet, workout, and sleep schedules. The trainer can also view user's progress and adjust their schedules.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Sleep Data Predictor
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A sleep data predictor that takes users sleep data to extrapolate their health conditions and give tips on optimizing their sleep.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
Possible ideas to make REVITALIZE accessible to all people include designing clear layouts, increasing font sizes, increasing text visibility, using large buttons and controls, and describing user interface elements. Another idea to prevent API failures is to run tests to monitor and track API performance from early development through production.

\section{Reflection Appendix}

\subsection{Knowledge and Skills Needed}

\noindent Bill Nguyen: Skills that the team needs to acquire are end to end development, CI/CD, multiple ways of testing (integration, unit, acceptance tests etc...). This will be needed since project is end to end (front-end, back-end, database etc.), will be using CI/CD to deploy code changes, and will be testing project in multiple ways.\\

\noindent Syed Bokhari: Skills relating to API integration and server communication are needed for the technical development of the application. This is needed because the project depends on the use of multiple APIs for the core functionality of its features. Knowledge of server communication is required due to the nature of application development as the dynamic application information requires constant feedback from the server. \\

\noindent Youssef Dahab: The team will collectively need to acquire documentation skills to successfully complete this project. This includes learning how to write requirements (functional and non functional), how to create use case diagrams, class diagrams, activity diagrams, design documents, how to make a hazard analysis, V\&V plan and report.\\

\noindent Mahmoud Anklis: The team will need to acquire skills pertaining to app development for Android. This will include setting up an emulator that the application can be run and tested on. This will also include setting up the most efficient IDE that will enable the team to develop smoothly.\\ 

\noindent Logan Brown: The team will need to learn how to effectively communicate with stakeholders who do not necessarily understand technical aspects of software. More specifically, this includes knowing how to discern and understand what the client wants and effectively implementing it in the end product. Understanding and responding to stakeholder feedback is another important aspect that must be learned.\\

\noindent Hasan Kibria: Skills that need to be acquired are development with mobile app frameworks and deployment of mobile applications.\\

\subsection{How Knowledge and Skills Will Be Acquired}

\noindent Bill Nguyen: Project will be end to end so will implement code in front-end, back-end etc. and will be integrating all components to make it an end to end project. Will use CI/CD in project to integrate and deploy code, so will add necessary steps in yaml file to make and update CI/CD process. Will research and implement unit, integration, acceptance tests etc. to learn more about multiple types of tests. \\

\noindent Syed Bokhari: The knowledge relating to API integration will be acquired through reading API specific documentation and creating test API applications to test the correct functionality of each API in use. The server communication will be learned through research and development of the project.\\

\noindent Youssef Dahab: An approach to acquire such knowledge is to attend 4G06 course lectures and tutorials, and ask questions to the professor and TAs whenever needed. Another approach is to look up 4G0G lecture notes or past notes from relevant courses such as SFWRENG 2AA4 or 3XA3 and to search or read online on how to properly and correctly document requirements, implementation, test plans, and design documents. I will mainly pursue the second approach as I do not often attend lectures.\\

\noindent Mahmoud Anklis: Online research will play a pivotal role in acquiring the knowledge to develop an Android application. This may include videos, blogs, courses, and tutorials that cover topics from developing to setting up an emulator. The online IDE documentation will also be consulted for any IDE issues. App-Dev books may also be used as a resource.\\

\noindent Logan Brown: Principles drawn from previous courses such as 3RA3, 3I03, as well as lectures in this course will be instrumental in making sure communication goes smoothly. Some trial and error will be required as communication skills are often acquired through experience. Previous experience such as members who have completed co-ops will aid the entire group\\ through teaching what they already know.\\

\noindent Hasan Kibria: Developing/ deploying the codebase that uses a development mobile app framework and using Stack Overflow/ other online resources for ongoing guidance with regards to development as well as deploying.\\
