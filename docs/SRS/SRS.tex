\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
Sustaining a healthy lifestyle requires people to keep track of their eating, exercising, and sleeping habits. This can prove to be a daunting and time consuming thing to do especially when most people are very busy with their lives. The purpose of this project to create an all in one health and wellness mobile application that allows users to manage their diet, exercise, and sleep. REVITALIZE is designed to supply users with the means to improve their health by providing them with meal recipe's based on their nutritional preferences, a personalized workouts planner and a sleep tracker. 
\subsection{Scope}
REVITALIZE will allow users to find recipes for meals based on nutritional preferences such as calories per meal, diet selections, allergies to avoid and ingredients included. The user will be able to count their calorie and nutrient intake through the nutrition logger. The workout planner will allow users to choose from an already existing list of workouts or construct their own workout schedule along with weights, sets, and repetitions. The sleep tracker will provide users with information regarding their sleep.

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{Primary Stakeholders}
Adults and teenagers who want to improve and keep track of their overall health and wellness via an easy to use, all in one application.

\subsubsection{Secondary Stakeholders}
Individuals who may not use the application directly for themselves
or are not directly involved with the use of the application but have an indirect benefit. For instance, personal trainers can use REVITALIZE to keep track of workouts, sleep, and the overall health of their clients.

\subsubsection{Facilitating Stakeholders}
Team 13 members building the REVITALIZE application. \\
Dr.Spencer Smith and the 4G06 TAs.
